## Features

### Classic Design

I've carefully recreated the design to tickle the nostalgia of all Pokémon classic gamers and anime fans. The design is an accurate representation of the original Pokédex device, providing an immersive experience.

### Extensive Pokémon Information

Explore detailed information about all Pokémon, including their names, types, abilities, stats, and evolutions. Dive into the world of Pokémon and enhance your knowledge.

### Responsive Design an Unique Challenge

My web app is optimized for a seamless experience on all types of devices. This cas the most challenging part in the whole project, the since the design is of a device with a display, all contents must scale perfectly no matter what the viewport size is. This meant scaling the font sizes, gaps, animations etc. After carefull thought and work this feature is now completly operational. so have see for yourself.
